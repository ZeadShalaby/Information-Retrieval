gnu librari general public licens version june copyright c free softwar foundat inc franklin street fifth floor boston ma usa everyon is permit to copi and distribut verbatim copi of this licens document but chang it is not allow this is the first releas version of the librari gpl it is number becaus it goe with version of the ordinari gpl preambl the licens for most softwar are design to take away your freedom to share and chang it by contrast the gnu general public licens are intend to guarante your freedom to share and chang free softwareto make sure the softwar is free for all it user this licens the librari general public licens appli to some special design free softwar foundat softwar and to ani other librari whose author decid to use it you can use it for your librari too when we speak of free softwar we are refer to freedom not price our general public licens are design to make sure that you have the freedom to distribut copi of free softwar and charg for this servic if you wish that you receiv sourc code or can get it if you want it that you can chang the softwar or use piec of it in new free program and that you know you can do these thing to protect your right we need to make restrict that forbid anyon to deni you these right or to ask you to surrend the right these restrict translat to certain respons for you if you distribut copi of the librari or if you modifi it for exampl if you distribut copi of the librari whether grati or for a fee you must give the recipi all the right that we gave you you must make sure that they too receiv or can get the sourc code if you link a program with the librari you must provid complet object file to the recipi so that they can relink them with the librari after make chang to the librari and recompil it and you must show them these term so they know their right our method of protect your right has two step copyright the librari and offer you this licens which give you legal permiss to copi distribut andor modifi the librari also for each distributor protect we want to make certain that everyon understand that there is no warranti for this free librari if the librari is modifi by someon els and pass on we want it recipi to know that what they have is not the origin version so that ani problem introduc by other will not reflect on the origin author reput final ani free program is threaten constant by softwar patent we wish to avoid the danger that compani distribut free softwar will individu obtain patent licens thus in effect transform the program into proprietari softwar to prevent this we have made it clear that ani patent must be licens for everyon free use or not licens at all most gnu softwar includ some librari is cover by the ordinari gnu general public licens which was design for util program this licens the gnu librari general public licens appli to certain design librari this licens is quit differ from the ordinari one be sure to read it in full and dont assum that anyth in it is the same as in the ordinari licens the reason we have a separ public licens for some librari is that they blur the distinct we usual make between modifi or ad to a program and simpli use it link a program with a librari without chang the librari is in some sens simpli use the librari and is analog to run a util program or applic program howev in a textual and legal sens the link execut is a combin work a deriv of the origin librari and the ordinari general public licens treat it as such becaus of this blur distinct use the ordinari general public licens for librari did not effect promot softwar share becaus most develop did not use the librari we conclud that weaker condit might promot share better howev unrestrict link of nonfre program would depriv the user of those program of all benefit from the free status of the librari themselv this librari general public licens is intend to permit develop of nonfre program to use free librari while preserv your freedom as a user of such program to chang the free librari that are incorpor in them we have not seen how to achiev this as regard chang in header file but we have achiev it as regard chang in the actual function of the librari the hope is that this will lead to faster develop of free librari the precis term and condit for copi distribut and modif follow pay close attent to the differ between a work base on the librari and a work that use the librari the former contain code deriv from the librari while the latter onli work togeth with the librari note that it is possibl for a librari to be cover by the ordinari general public licens rather than by this special one gnu librari general public licens term and condit for copi distribut and modif this licens agreement appli to ani softwar librari which contain a notic place by the copyright holder or other author parti say it may be distribut under the term of this librari general public licens also call this licens each license is address as you a librari mean a collect of softwar function andor data prepar so as to be conveni link with applic program which use some of those function and data to form execut the librari below refer to ani such softwar librari or work which has been distribut under these term a work base on the librari mean either the librari or ani deriv work under copyright law that is to say a work contain the librari or a portion of it either verbatim or with modif andor translat straightforward into anoth languag hereinaft translat is includ without limit in the term modif sourc code for a work mean the prefer form of the work for make modif to it for a librari complet sourc code mean all the sourc code for all modul it contain plus ani associ interfac definit file plus the script use to control compil and instal of the librari activ other than copi distribut and modif are not cover by this licens they are outsid it scope the act of run a program use the librari is not restrict and output from such a program is cover onli if it content constitut a work base on the librari independ of the use of the librari in a tool for write it whether that is true depend on what the librari doe and what the program that use the librari doe you may copi and distribut verbatim copi of the librari complet sourc code as you receiv it in ani medium provid that you conspicu and appropri publish on each copi an appropri copyright notic and disclaim of warranti keep intact all the notic that refer to this licens and to the absenc of ani warranti and distribut a copi of this licens along with the librari you may charg a fee for the physic act of transfer a copi and you may at your option offer warranti protect in exchang for a fee you may modifi your copi or copi of the librari or ani portion of it thus form a work base on the librari and copi and distribut such modif or work under the term of section abov provid that you also meet all of these condit a the modifi work must itself be a softwar librari b you must caus the file modifi to carri promin notic state that you chang the file and the date of ani chang c you must caus the whole of the work to be licens at no charg to all third parti under the term of this licens d if a facil in the modifi librari refer to a function or a tabl of data to be suppli by an applic program that use the facil other than as an argument pass when the facil is invok then you must make a good faith effort to ensur that in the event an applic doe not suppli such function or tabl the facil still oper and perform whatev part of it purpos remain meaning for exampl a function in a librari to comput squar root has a purpos that is entir welldefin independ of the applic therefor subsect d requir that ani applicationsuppli function or tabl use by this function must be option if the applic doe not suppli it the squar root function must still comput squar root these requir appli to the modifi work as a whole if identifi section of that work are not deriv from the librari and can be reason consid independ and separ work in themselv then this licens and it term do not appli to those section when you distribut them as separ work but when you distribut the same section as part of a whole which is a work base on the librari the distribut of the whole must be on the term of this licens whose permiss for other license extend to the entir whole and thus to each and everi part regardless of who wrote it thus it is not the intent of this section to claim right or contest your right to work written entir by you rather the intent is to exercis the right to control the distribut of deriv or collect work base on the librari in addit mere aggreg of anoth work not base on the librari with the librari or with a work base on the librari on a volum of a storag or distribut medium doe not bring the other work under the scope of this licens you may opt to appli the term of the ordinari gnu general public licens instead of this licens to a given copi of the librari to do this you must alter all the notic that refer to this licens so that they refer to the ordinari gnu general public licens version instead of to this licens if a newer version than version of the ordinari gnu general public licens has appear then you can specifi that version instead if you wish do not make ani other chang in these notic onc this chang is made in a given copi it is irrevers for that copi so the ordinari gnu general public licens appli to all subsequ copi and deriv work made from that copi this option is use when you wish to copi part of the code of the librari into a program that is not a librari you may copi and distribut the librari or a portion or deriv of it under section in object code or execut form under the term of section and abov provid that you accompani it with the complet correspond machineread sourc code which must be distribut under the term of section and abov on a medium customarili use for softwar interchang if distribut of object code is made by offer access to copi from a design place then offer equival access to copi the sourc code from the same place satisfi the requir to distribut the sourc code even though third parti are not compel to copi the sourc along with the object code a program that contain no deriv of ani portion of the librari but is design to work with the librari by be compil or link with it is call a work that use the librari such a work in isol is not a deriv work of the librari and therefor fall outsid the scope of this licens howev link a work that use the librari with the librari creat an execut that is a deriv of the librari becaus it contain portion of the librari rather than a work that use the librari the execut is therefor cover by this licens section state term for distribut of such execut when a work that use the librari use materi from a header file that is part of the librari the object code for the work may be a deriv work of the librari even though the sourc code is not whether this is true is especi signific if the work can be link without the librari or if the work is itself a librari the threshold for this to be true is not precis defin by law if such an object file use onli numer paramet data structur layout and accessor and small macro and small inlin function ten line or less in length then the use of the object file is unrestrict regardless of whether it is legal a deriv work execut contain this object code plus portion of the librari will still fall under section otherwis if the work is a deriv of the librari you may distribut the object code for the work under the term of section ani execut contain that work also fall under section whether or not they are link direct with the librari itself as an except to the section abov you may also compil or link a work that use the librari with the librari to produc a work contain portion of the librari and distribut that work under term of your choic provid that the term permit modif of the work for the custom own use and revers engin for debug such modif you must give promin notic with each copi of the work that the librari is use in it and that the librari and it use are cover by this licens you must suppli a copi of this licens if the work dure execut display copyright notic you must includ the copyright notic for the librari among them as well as a refer direct the user to the copi of this licens also you must do one of these thing a accompani the work with the complet correspond machineread sourc code for the librari includ whatev chang were use in the work which must be distribut under section and abov and if the work is an execut link with the librari with the complet machineread work that use the librari as object code andor sourc code so that the user can modifi the librari and then relink to produc a modifi execut contain the modifi librari it is understood that the user who chang the content of definit file in the librari will not necessarili be abl to recompil the applic to use the modifi definit b accompani the work with a written offer valid for at least three year to give the same user the materi specifi in subsect a abov for a charg no more than the cost of perform this distribut c if distribut of the work is made by offer access to copi from a design place offer equival access to copi the abov specifi materi from the same place d verifi that the user has alreadi receiv a copi of these materi or that you have alreadi sent this user a copi for an execut the requir form of the work that use the librari must includ ani data and util program need for reproduc the execut from it howev as a special except the sourc code distribut need not includ anyth that is normal distribut in either sourc or binari form with the major compon compil kernel and so on of the oper system on which the execut run unless that compon itself accompani the execut it may happen that this requir contradict the licens restrict of other proprietari librari that do not normal accompani the oper system such a contradict mean you cannot use both them and the librari togeth in an execut that you distribut you may place librari facil that are a work base on the librari sidebysid in a singl librari togeth with other librari facil not cover by this licens and distribut such a combin librari provid that the separ distribut of the work base on the librari and of the other librari facil is otherwis permit and provid that you do these two thing a accompani the combin librari with a copi of the same work base on the librari uncombin with ani other librari facil this must be distribut under the term of the section abov b give promin notic with the combin librari of the fact that part of it is a work base on the librari and explain where to find the accompani uncombin form of the same work you may not copi modifi sublicens link with or distribut the librari except as expressli provid under this licens ani attempt otherwis to copi modifi sublicens link with or distribut the librari is void and will automat termin your right under this licens howev parti who have receiv copi or right from you under this licens will not have their licens termin so long as such parti remain in full complianc you are not requir to accept this licens sinc you have not sign it howev noth els grant you permiss to modifi or distribut the librari or it deriv work these action are prohibit by law if you do not accept this licens therefor by modifi or distribut the librari or ani work base on the librari you indic your accept of this licens to do so and all it term and condit for copi distribut or modifi the librari or work base on it each time you redistribut the librari or ani work base on the librari the recipi automat receiv a licens from the origin licensor to copi distribut link with or modifi the librari subject to these term and condit you may not impos ani further restrict on the recipi exercis of the right grant herein you are not respons for enforc complianc by third parti to this licens if as a consequ of a court judgment or alleg of patent infring or for ani other reason not limit to patent issu condit are impos on you whether by court order agreement or otherwis that contradict the condit of this licens they do not excus you from the condit of this licens if you cannot distribut so as to satisfi simultan your oblig under this licens and ani other pertin oblig then as a consequ you may not distribut the librari at all for exampl if a patent licens would not permit royaltyfre redistribut of the librari by all those who receiv copi direct or indirect through you then the onli way you could satisfi both it and this licens would be to refrain entir from distribut of the librari if ani portion of this section is held invalid or unenforc under ani particular circumst the balanc of the section is intend to appli and the section as a whole is intend to appli in other circumst it is not the purpos of this section to induc you to infring ani patent or other properti right claim or to contest valid of ani such claim this section has the sole purpos of protect the integr of the free softwar distribut system which is implement by public licens practic mani peopl have made generous contribut to the wide rang of softwar distribut through that system in relianc on consist applic of that system it is up to the authordonor to decid if he or she is will to distribut softwar through ani other system and a license cannot impos that choic this section is intend to make thorough clear what is believ to be a consequ of the rest of this licens if the distribut andor use of the librari is restrict in certain countri either by patent or by copyright interfac the origin copyright holder who place the librari under this licens may add an explicit geograph distribut limit exclud those countri so that distribut is permit onli in or among countri not thus exclud in such case this licens incorpor the limit as if written in the bodi of this licens the free softwar foundat may publish revis andor new version of the librari general public licens from time to time such new version will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problem or concern each version is given a distinguish version number if the librari specifi a version number of this licens which appli to it and ani later version you have the option of follow the term and condit either of that version or of ani later version publish by the free softwar foundat if the librari doe not specifi a licens version number you may choos ani version ever publish by the free softwar foundat if you wish to incorpor part of the librari into other free program whose distribut condit are incompat with these write to the author to ask for permiss for softwar which is copyright by the free softwar foundat write to the free softwar foundat we sometim make except for this our decis will be guid by the two goal of preserv the free status of all deriv of our free softwar and of promot the share and reus of softwar general no warranti becaus the librari is licens free of charg there is
