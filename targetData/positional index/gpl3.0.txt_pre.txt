concern interact through a network will appli to the combin as such revis version of this licens the free softwar foundat may publish revis andor new version of the gnu general public licens from time to time such new version will be similar in spirit to the present version but may differ in detail to address new problem or concern each version is given a distinguish version number if the program specifi that a certain number version of the gnu general public licens or ani later version appli to it you have the option of follow the term and condit either of that number version or of ani later version publish by the free softwar foundat if the program doe not specifi a version number of the gnu general public licens you may choos ani version ever publish by the free softwar foundat if the

law that most close approxim an absolut waiver of all civil liabil in connect with the program unless a warranti or assumpt of liabil accompani a copi of the program in return for a fee end of term and condit how to appli these term to your new program if you develop a new program and you want it to be of the greatest possibl use to the public the best way to achiev this is to make it free softwar which everyon can redistribut and chang under these term to do so attach the follow notic to the program it is safest to attach them to the start of each sourc file to most effect state the exclus of warranti and each file should have at least the copyright line and a pointer to where the full notic is found one line to give the program name and a brief idea of what it doe copyright c year name of author this program is free softwar you can redistribut it andor modifi it under the term of the gnu general public licens as publish by the free softwar foundat either version of the licens or at your option ani later version this program is distribut in the hope that it will be use but without ani warranti without even the impli warranti of merchant or fit for a particular purpos see the gnu general public licens for more detail you should have receiv a copi of the gnu general public licens along with this program if not see httpwwwgnuorglicens also add inform on how to

licens doe not permit incorpor your program into proprietari program if your program is a subroutin librari you may consid it more use to permit link proprietari applic with the librari if this is
